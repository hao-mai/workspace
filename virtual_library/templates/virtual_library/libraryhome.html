  <h3>What the project is about</h3>
  <div class="virtual-library-project">
    <p>A web application that provides users with access to a digital library to check out books.</p>
    The app would have features such as user authentication and authorization, so that users can create accounts, log in, and access their own library of resources.
    <p>It could also have search and filtering functionality, allowing users to search for resources by title, author, genre, or other criteria. </p>
    <p>Behind the scenes, the app may use a variety of technologies such as Django for the server-side code, a database to store user and resource information, and various APIs for accessing and integrating with external services such as payment processors, digital media providers, and recommendation engines.</p>
